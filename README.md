# CommuteGuardian
Urban commuting failures cause Â£15B+ annual economic losses in the UK, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations like medical travelers. This paper presents \emph{CommuteGuardian}, a context-aware ontology leveraging semantic reasoning to predict and mitigate commute disruptions. By integrating real-time transport data, commuter profiles, and environmental factors through OWL/SWRL constructs, the system triggers proactive solutions during critical scenarios (e.g., rerouting diabetics during insulin-cooling crises). Evaluations demonstrate a \textbf{73\% reduction in missed critical appointments} and 89\% accuracy in cascade risk prediction. Key innovations include ethical data anonymization workflows and semantic chain modeling for downstream risk forecasting. The ontology outperforms ML baselines by 27\% in prediction accuracy while maintaining GDPR compliance through class-based abstraction.
